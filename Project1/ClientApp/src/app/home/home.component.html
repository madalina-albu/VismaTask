<h1>Programming task</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The task should be solved using ASP.NET Core (.NET 5.0) with Angular and C# as the programming language. The solution should be returned with a full source.</p>
<p>Create a simple application which can be used for calculation of the cost from a housing loan.</p>
<p>The application should have a simple user interface where the user can specify the desired amount and the payback time in years.</p>
<p>For simplicity we assume a fixed interest of 3.5% per year during the complete payback time.</p>
<p>The interest should be connected to the loan type in such a manner that different loan types can have different interests.</p>
<p>When selecting the amount and payback time, the application should generate a monthly payback plan based on the series loan principle, i.e. you pay back an equal amount each month and add the generated interest. The interest is calculated every month.</p>
<p>The application should be made in such a manner that it can easily be extended to calculate a payment plan for other types of loans, for instance car loan, spending loan etc. with different interests.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that it should be easy to extend the application to cover other payback schemes as well. We do not expect this to be implemented.</p>
<p>We expect that you demonstrate reasonable use of the available language functionality for abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, a good class structure and show a good programming practice.</p>
<p>We are interested to see use of Angular and Typescript on the webpage. We are focused on code quality and good design, so it is nice if you add a design sketch.</p>
